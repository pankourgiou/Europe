So, this is the interpreter for a programming language called Europe! It's bassed on R programming language and since it's still on it's first steps it does some very basic things.
For example:
1)it prints messages using € symbol
2)it uses if statements with ?
3)it loops with ∞
4)it does variable assignment with :=
5)function definition, def
5 actions yet it's still on the beginning.
